-------------------------------------------------------Week 1

Two types of thinking: focus mode and diffuse mode.
You can’t think in both types at the same time. There could be only one driver in a car.
Your brain requires focus mode, when it needs to solve common, well-known tasks. Such as calculating numbers or writing a report. Focus mode stands on using stages, so it is a kind of algorithm. And your brain knows where all stages are, and how to complete them.
But when you try to solve a creative task, you don’t know how to solve it. You have no algorithm. So you must think more widely, without using habitual stages. It is more effective.

Historical review: Salvador Dali, Thomas Edison utilized a defuse mode of thinking to invent. They let their mind free sitting in the chair and falling to nap. 
The bottom line is that when you are learning, you must use both of thinking modes.

Your brain is a kind of muscle. Train your intelligence every day. It will build neural basement of your thinking machine. Real learning can take a lot of time, as building your muscles up. 

Metaphor – is a very powerful technique of learning. 

So, what is learning?
Your brain is the most complex device in the known universe. When we interact with world, the external parts of the brain are active. And when we are relaxing the internal part works (we can call it a default mode). 
There are a lot of synapses on the dendrites in the brain. Our memory is stored in billions of synapses. New synapses form on the dendrite after learning and sleeping. 
Building a new neural structure is like building a brick wall. U can’t build it in one day. Some things just take time. One day – one brick.

Everybody has procrastination problems. It’s a neural discomfort. But the key is that when you start doing this discomfort will disappear. So, the Pomodoro method can help. You should focus on the task for only 25 minutes. You should work very hard and turn off all interrupters. After that relax for some time and think about materials.

Everybody can learn almost everything. Regular efforts are the best way. Persistence is the key, not an inherent intelligence.

We have working (4 slots) memory and long-termed memory. So, the key way is to repeat something a bit every day to put it into long-termed memory. If you repeat something 20 times a day u deal only with working memory. It’s a useless way. Long-termed memory is like a big warehouse, full of containers. Short-termed memory is like a poor blackboard that quickly erases itself.

Sleeping is very important. During sleeping brain washes away toxins that develop during our day activities. Good learning can happen after good sleeping. You should dream about goals and subjects during sleeping. You may try to sleep right after learning. You should clearly determine yourself to dream about it before going to a bed. It is a very effective method.

Sport is a very powerful method too. It helps you to dramatically change your activity, so your brain can relax very deep during swimming or running. 

To make a great product, u must be non-conformal and conformal at the same time. Conformism helps u to satisfy customers and to be opened to their opinion. Non-conformism helps u to be more creative and to make a special product.

Mindmap method for creative thinking is very useful. Put the circle with key word to the center of horizontally oriented list of paper. And then think about associations with this subject and just build chains of them. Make a web of your thoughts. It helps u to remember this schema of thoughts very effectively.

The main rule of creative process: don’t edit yourself while you are working. If u write something, for example a short story, don’t look at the display at all, just write to the end. And only after that you can start to review. So, write without looking what you are writing. Also don’t edit anything in your head. Don’t listen to voice in your head, which says that you are doing something wrong. Just do your work without any review. Make a great review only when you have finished, not early.



-------------------------------------------------------Week 2

The illusion of competence is a very common case. It’s easy to think that you are competent when you just see the right answer or way doing something. You think that it comes from your own head, but it is not true. There are no neural links about this material. 
The only way to learn something and to make neural links about this skill is to do it yourself. First, do it with mistakes, and then correct them. Always test yourself to understand whether you are actually learning or whether you have been fooling yourself.

Recalling is also a good idea. It is mental retrieval of the key ideas. Recalling the material makes new neural links. Always try to recall all that you’ve learned without prying into the book. Neural links are strongly developing during this process.

Chunking is a powerful method of learning. Chunk is a small skill or small piece of understanding in your mind, it is a compact package of information, that your mind can easily access. Chunk works only when neural links of some skill are created. So to make a chunk you must practice a lot. Chunks are guitar chords. First you should learn every single chord. But when it’s done you can combine them into a melody. This approach is relevant for every type of skill.
The best chunk is that one that is so well ingrained that you don’t consciously think about how to do it at all.
To understand a complicated topic you should divide it into a group of meaningful chunks. Then try to understand every single chunk. Then combine them.
You can create chunk ONLY with three components: focused attention, understanding and practice.

There are a high-to-bottom way of learning and a bottom-to-high. You should combine both ways. High-to-bottom means to look at the picture in its entirety. Bottom-to-high means to form simple chunks that are useful but without understanding of the whole idea. You can combine these two methods in a context. Context helps to understand when to use a chunk and when not to do it. Context means to practice.

Try to study the same material in different places. It can be more effective than studying in the same class every time.

What motivates you? There are three great neuromodulators in our brains. Serotonin affects social life, libido and risk-taking behavior. Dopamine signals in relation of unexpected reward and affects motivation. Acetylcholine affects focused learning and attention.

Transfer – is the idea that a chunk you have mastered in one area can help you to create new chunks in another area. 

Library of chunks is your mental library. Every time when you have mastered a chunk you fill your mental library. The bigger it is the better you are in studying something new. Combining the chunks from different fields of knowledge in diffuse mode of thinking is one of the best ways to make creative ideas. You can find something radically new when you think such way.

Mindset is a habitual way of thinking which can block your creativity. It is an initial thought, an idea you have already had in mind, which prevents a better idea or solution from being found. It keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new solutions.

Interleaving helps you to create chunks in different fields of knowledge. Learn different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session. Try to solve one problem in different ways. It will make you more creative. Interleaving helps you to understand when and how to use a particular method.

Deliberate practice is a way to focus on the most complicated tasks for some time. The ability to practice such way is what makes a difference between a good student and a great student.

Overlearning takes place when you get stuck in your current level. Don’t repeat the same material again and again, because it is very easy for you. Instead of that always try to go further, otherwise it can be just spending you valuable time.


-------------------------------------------------------Week 3

Procrastination is a very common case. It is like a small doze of poison, which u swallow every day. It’s not very dangerous itself, but it becomes more and more dangerous every day, because it can accumulate in your mind. It becomes a very strong habit. Outwardly you look good but the poison is spreading inside you mind. Procrastination affects a lot of aspects of your life. Procrastination brings you temporary relief from sometimes boring reality. But it is a trap.

Every human has a zombie mode. It is when you do something automatically, like riding a bicycle. Usually we call it a habit. A habit can be very brief, like brushing back your hair, and very long like playing games after work or watching TV shows in the morning. Every habit has four parts: the cue, the routine (response for cue), the reward, the belief.

So, here are some approaches to win the fight with procrastination:
•	Eat your frogs first in the morning
•	Watch for the cues which launch procrastination and fix them
•	Always set deadlines for yourself. It will help you to work faster
•	It’s better to have a plan for your day on the list of paper not in your mind
•	Try to focus on process not on product (purpose). Your purpose can be hard to reach and in this case it will discourage you. Your purpose can trigger the pain that causes you to procrastinate.

Memory is the basement of knowledge. To create a strong knowledge we must push new information to long-termed memory from short-termed memory. The only way to do this is to repeat info many times day after day, because the strongest neural links of long-termed memory form only during sleeping.
Our memory is super complicated substance. All memories which are stored there are chained with each other. If one of them changes, another can also change. Memories are not fixed, they can change during their lifetime. 

Memory palace technique is a powerful method to create and remember meaningful groups that simplify the material.
Use your visual memory (or auditory memory or maybe taste memory) whenever you can. The funnier and more evocative images the better.

The associations are one of the best practices for remembering names, numbers and etc. It can be visual pictures or some feelings.
To have better memory you must practice every day. Always try to recall before highlighting. 

The best way to solve a problem is to switch between focus and diffuse modes of thinking. If you get stuck solving the task just do sports or something else, which can involve all our brain. During this your deep layers of mind are working on the problem. Then return to the problem and focus only on it. You must be very focused or very detached.

Imposter syndrome is a tough problem for lots of people, which interferes them from getting real success. Always remember that another people are not as clever as they want to pretend. They usually feel the same fear inside their hearts. Also remember that perseverance in learning is better than inherit abilities. Be proud of your efforts.

Metaphor and analogy are extremely powerful methods of learning. They are really helpful in different kinds of sciences. They help to remember and to understand the system. Try to imagine yourself as a problem which you are trying to solve.

Ladder of abstractions is a metaphor itself and a powerful method of thinking. Use it to explain your ideas to people. On the top of this ladder are abstract things, your ideas like creation of something or freedom. To write about them and to explain them well, go down to the bottom (to the world of real things) and use these real things in explanation. So, this ladder can be your connection between abstract and real world.

In explanation of something, don’t try to be impressive, try to be clear. If you will be clear, you will be impressive automatically! Work on trying to be completely clear.

Learn to notice as much as you can! Notice is itself very potent method of cognition. Notice interesting thoughts of clever people, be attentive.

Learning to learn is the skill which you can master all your life. And you can use it to improve every part of your life. 

Physical exercises are by far more effective than any drug in the market to help you learn better. 

Testing and reviewing are definitely great methods of studying. They are very important to consolidate your knowledge.

Right and left hemispheres provide different types of thinking. Right hemisphere grants you an ability to look at the big picture (diffuse mode). If you are in focus mode you can do a mistake and don’t mention it. Always try to blink, shift your attention and turn your brain to diffuse mode. Check your work using a big-picture perspective.

Method “Hard start – jump to easy” to start with the hard problems and quickly jump to the easy one. Tackle the easiest problems first is not good approach for doing something. Start with the hardest problems but pull yourself away if you get stuck. Start doing easy tasks until you feel that you have some decision for the difficult. Think about difficult doing easy tasks. It activates your diffuse mode. The solution can just pop to your mind.

You are not truly learned something unless you can teach it to others. Try to explain all the material to somebody, even to imaginary companion.
